# Threads_And_ContextSwitch

A repository exploring threads and context switching in C.

## Overview
This project demonstrates and explains how threads work in C and what happens under the hood during context switching between threads. The included PDF contains a write-up (“Threads and Context Switching.pdf”) that covers theory, diagrams, and examples. The repository also contains example C code to illustrate these concepts in practice.

## Usage / How to Run
1. Start with *Threads and Context Switching.pdf* to review the concepts and examples.  
2. Navigate to either the *WarmUp* or *Problems* folder and look for C source files (`.c`).  
3. Compile any of the C files using `gcc` (or your preferred C compiler). For example:  
   ```bash
   gcc -pthread example.c -o example
